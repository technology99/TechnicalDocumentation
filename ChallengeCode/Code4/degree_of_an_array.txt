"Degree of an array (sample question)"

Given a non-empty array N, of non-negative integers,
the degree of this array is defined as the maximum 
frequency of any one of its elements. Your task is
to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous)
subarray of N, that has the same degree as N. For
example, in the array [1 2 2 3 1], integer 2 occurs 
maximum of twice. Hence the degree is 2.

Input

Test case input contains 2 lines.
First line contains an integer T,
representing the number of elements
in the array. The second line contains
the array N, list of T integers each
separated by space.

Output

Print the length of the smallest contiguous
subarray of input array N, that the same
degree as N. Code evaluation is based on
your output, please follow the sample format
and do NOT print anything else.
